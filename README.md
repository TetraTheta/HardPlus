## Introduction
Many skilled Minecraft players think that Hard, the highest level of difficulty in Minecraft, is also easy.  
That's why this plugin is developed. HardPlus will challenge those players with extra difficulty tweaks.

Don't worry about not-skilled players. Since HardPlus uses permission for each tweak, if you don't give not-skilled players the corresponding permission, they won't get suffered from HardPlus. 

For more information, head to [wiki](https://github.com/TetraTheta/HardPlus/wiki) for a detailed explanation of what each module does.

This plugin is highly motivated from [Fundy's video](https://youtu.be/Z5Y8uwpJrhs).
